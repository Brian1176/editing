<p>Legend: {[ are the selection anchor, }] are the selection focus, {}
represent an element boundary point, [] represent a text node boundary point.
Syntax and some of the tests taken from <a
href=http://www.browserscope.org/richtext2/test>Browserscope</a>.  data-start
and data-end attributes also represent element boundary points, with the node
being the element with the attribute and the offset given as the attribute
value, for cases where HTML parsing doesn't allow text nodes.  Currently we
don't really pay attention to reversed selections at all, so they might get
displayed as forwards or such.

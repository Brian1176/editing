<h2 class=no-num>Status of this Document</h2>
<p>This document is an early draft of a specification for HTML editing APIs,
defining <code>execCommand()</code> and related functions.  It will eventually
be merged into the main <a href=http://www.whatwg.org/html>HTML</a>
specification, replacing the <a
href=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dnd.html#editing-apis>Editing
APIs</a> section.  Although this spec is still very incomplete and will likely
be changed heavily before it's finished, feedback to <a
href=http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org>the WHATWG list</a>
is encouraged, particularly from implementers and particularly from authors who
have experience using this feature.


<h2 class=no-num>Table of contents</h2>
<!--toc-->


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This specification defines commands to edit HTML documents programmatically.
The APIs specified here were originally introduced in Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, but have subsequently been copied by other browsers in a haphazard
and imprecise fashion.  Although the behavior specified here does not exactly
match any browser at the time of writing, it can serve as a target to converge
to in the future.

<p>Where the reasoning behind the specification is of interest, such as when
major preexisting rendering engines are known not to match it, the reasoning is
included in HTML comments so as not to distract the reader.

<p>The principles I've used for writing this specification so far are:

<ul>
  <li>If all browsers that implement a particular feature agree on some detail
  of how it works, match them unless there's very good reason not to.  When
  it's not clear what behavior is best, try to follow the implementations with
  the most market share.  But if one browser's behavior is clearly better than
  the others', go with the better behavior.

  <li>If a command is issued to format some text in a particular way, we will
  format the text that way no matter what.  If the user clicks the "bold"
  button, they don't care that the text didn't become bold because of an
  external CSS rule or for any other reason, they only care that it didn't
  work.  The only exception (beyond where it's simply impossible, like
  propagated text-decorations we can't remove) is that we don't try to override
  !important rules from external stylesheets, although we also don't go out of
  our way to respect them.

  <li>When we're given a presentational command like "bold", don't modify
  anything other than presentational markup related to that command.  If an
  element has non-presentational attributes like id or class, don't split it up
  or remove it or anything.  At most convert it to a span, if it's some type of
  presentational element (where "presentational" here really means "browsers
  produce it in response to execCommand() so we need to treat it as
  presentational", so it includes things like [[strong]] and [[em]]).

  <li>Don't interfere with more markup than necessary.  If the user modifies
  only a small run of text, don't go around simplifying ancestors or siblings
  or whatever unless it's necessary to produce simpler markup in the place that
  was actually modified.

  <li>But if we are already changing around something's style, convert existing
  styles to the preferred format.  For instance, we use [[b]] for bold, and
  convert [[strong]] and &lt;[[span]] [[style]]="font-weight: bold"> if we
  happen to be modifying that node anyway.

  <li>Don't make the document less conforming than it originally was.  If we
  happen to make it more conforming, good, although we don't have to go out of
  our way to do that.  (In the future, I'll add a mode that supports using
  obsolete presentational elements instead of CSS for the sake of e-mail
  clients and such, and this rule will be bent in that mode.)

  <li>Keep the markup as concise as possible.  (I've received feedback that
  this is very important to authors.)  Ideally, the markup should look as
  simple and neat as what a human would have produced by hand-editing.  We do
  complicated manipulation to pull styles down from ancestors rather than
  having to use inline CSS, and make sure to tidy up any styles on elements
  that we happen to be modifying anyway.  Previous principles take precedence
  over this one, however.
</ul>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>This specification is very preliminary, and should not be used for anything
other than review and comment.

<ul>
  <li>Need to make CSS terminology more precise, about setting/unsetting CSS
  properties.  The intent is to modify the style attribute, CSSOM-style.
  Likewise, CSS value comparisons need to be done after serializing both
  values, so "bold" == "700" and "red" == "#f00" and so on.

  <li>Also not sure about computed style.  There are differences between
  "computed" and "used" and things like that, what do we actually want here?

  <li>The wording I use for DOM stuff is not maximally precise.  Really I want
  DOM Core to define nice concepts that I can xref, like "insert a node".  I
  don't want to have to explicitly refer to DOM methods like insertBefore()
  every time I want to move things.

  <li>I haven't put any thought yet into collapsed ranges or selections.
  Currently my algorithms mostly do nothing if the selection is collapsed,
  which is of course wrong.  E.g., bold with collapsed selection should put
  &lt;b>&lt;/b> at the cursor, generally.

  <li>Some more thought needs to go into what happens to the selection when you
  mutate the DOM.  In some cases the results are pretty arbitrary.  It might
  make sense to do some kind of normalization.

  <li>JavaScript can modify the DOM synchronously in some cases, such as DOM
  mutation events and onunload when moving around iframes and objects.  This
  has to be dealt with somehow.  (Pointed out by Ryosuke Niwa of WebKit: <a
  href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030730.html>1</a>
  <a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030751.html>2</a>)

  <li>I'm sloppy about handling things like nodes that don't descend from a
  Document, comments that are children of a Document, that sort of thing.  Not
  essential for prototyping, but needs to be cleaned up eventually.

  <li>I don't pay attention to whether designMode/contenteditable is actually
  set.  I should be doing things like not doing anything if the selection isn't
  editable, making sure not to break out of contenteditable regions, etc.

  <li>I haven't yet paid any attention to value parsing.  This is going to be
  important to specify exactly in some cases, like with colors.
</ul>

<p class=XXX>A variety of other issues are also noted in the text, formatted
like this.


<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>A [[node]] is an <dfn>HTML element</dfn> if it is an [[element]] whose
[[namespace]] is the [[htmlnamespace]].  An <code
data-anolis-spec=domcore>Attr</code> is an <dfn>HTML attribute</dfn> if its
<span data-anolis-spec=domcore title=concept-attr-namespace>namespace</span> is
the [[htmlnamespace]].

<p>A [[node]] is <dfn>effectively contained</dfn> in a [[range]] if either it
is [[contained]] in the [[range]]; or it is the [[range]]'s [[rangestart]]
[[bpnode]], it is a [[text]] node, and its [[nodelength]] is different from the
[[range]]'s [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]]; or it is the [[range]]'s [[rangeend]]
[[bpnode]], it is a [[text]] node, and the [[range]]'s [[rangeend]]
[[bpoffset]] is not 0; or it has at least one [[child]], and all its
[[children]] are <span>effectively contained</span> in the [[range]].
<!-- Logically, the effectively contained nodes are supposed to be the ones
returned by decomposing the range, or their descendants.  We can't actually
define it that way, because decomposing the range has side effects (calling
splitText()), and anyway text nodes might not be returned by decomposing even
if they're effectively contained: it might be that the new node created by
splitText() is returned. -->

<p>An <dfn>unwrappable element</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span> which may
not be used where only [[phrasingcontent]] is expected (not counting unknown or
obsolete elements, which cannot be used at all); or any [[element]] whose
display property computes to something other than "inline", "inline-block", or
"inline-table".

<p class=XXX>Currently when we hit an unwrappable element, we ignore it and
alter its children.  Alternatively, if we would otherwise create a span with a
style element on it, maybe we could put the style element directly on the
unwrappable element.  This would produce shorter markup in many cases, but
would also cause problems for things like background-color that do something
different on block elements.

<p>The <dfn>effective value</dfn> of a [[node]] <var>node</var> for a given
<var>command</var> is returned by the following algorithm, which will return
either a string or null:

<ol>
  <li>If neither <var>node</var> nor its [[parent]] is an [[element]], return
  null.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is not an [[element]], return the <span>effective
  value</span> of its [[parent]] for <var>command</var>.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "createLink" or "unlink":

  <ol>
    <li>While <var>node</var> is not null, and is not an [[a]] element that has
    an [[href]] attribute, set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

    <li>If <var>node</var> is null, return null.

    <li>Return the [[attrvalue]] of <var>node</var>'s [[href]] attribute.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "hiliteColor":

  <ol>
    <li>While the computed style of "background-color" on <var>node</var> is
    any fully transparent value, and <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is an
    [[element]], set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

    <li>If the computed style of "background-color" on <var>node</var> is
    a fully transparent value, return "rgb(255, 255, 255)".

    <li>Otherwise, return the computed style of "background-color" for
    <var>node</var>.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "subscript" or "superscript":

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>affected by subscript</var> and <var>affected by
    superscript</var> be two boolean variables, both initially false.

    <li>While <var>node</var> is an [[element]] whose "display" property
    computes to "inline":

    <ol>
      <li>If <var>node</var>'s "vertical-align" property computes to "sub", set
      <var>affected by subscript</var> to true.

      <li>Otherwise, if <var>node</var>'s "vertical-align" property computes to
      "super", set <var>affected by superscript</var> to true.

      <li>Otherwise, if <var>node</var>'s "vertical-align" property computes to
      some value other than "baseline", return the string "mixed".

      <li>Set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].
    </ol>

    <li>If <var>affected by subscript</var> and <var>affected by
    superscript</var> are both true, return the string "mixed".

    <li>If <var>affected by subscript</var> is true, return "sub".

    <li>If <var>affected by superscript</var> is true, return "super".

    <li>Return "baseline".
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "strikethrough", and the "text-decoration"
  property of <var>node</var> or any of its [[ancestors]] computes to
  a value containing "line-through", return "line-through".  Otherwise, return
  null.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "underline", and the "text-decoration"
  property of <var>node</var> or any of its [[ancestors]] computes to
  a value containing "underline", return "underline".  Otherwise, return
  null.

  <li>Return the computed style for <var>node</var> of the <span>relevant CSS
  property</span> for <var>command</var>.
</ol>

<p>The <dfn>specified value</dfn> of an [[element]] <var>element</var> for a
given <var>command</var> is returned by the following algorithm, which will
return either a string or null:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>command</var> is "hiliteColor" and the [[element]]'s
  display property does not compute to "inline", return null.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "createLink" or "unlink":

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>element</var> is an [[a]] element and has an [[href]]
    attribute, return the [[attrvalue]] of that attribute.

    <li>Return null.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "subscript" or "superscript":

  <ol>
    <li>If the computed value of <var>element</var>'s "display" property is
    neither "inline" nor "inline-block" nor "inline-table", return null.

    <li>If <var>element</var> has a [[style]] attribute set, and that attribute
    has the effect of setting "vertical-align", return the value that it sets
    "vertical-align" to.

    <li>If <var>element</var> is a [[sup]], return "super".

    <li>If <var>element</var> is a [[sub]], return "sub".

    <li>Return null.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "strikethrough", and <var>element</var> has a
  [[style]] attribute set, and that attribute sets "text-decoration":

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>element</var>'s [[style]] attribute sets "text-decoration" to a
    value containing "line-through", return "line-through".

    <li>Return null.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "strikethrough" and <var>element</var> is an
  [[s]] element, return "line-through".

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "underline", and <var>element</var> has a
  [[style]] attribute set, and that attribute sets "text-decoration":

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>element</var>'s [[style]] attribute sets "text-decoration" to a
    value containing "underline", return "underline".

    <li>Return null.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "underline" and <var>element</var> is a [[u]]
  element, return "underline".

  <li>Let <var>property</var> be the <span>relevant CSS property</span> for
  <var>command</var>.

  <li>If <var>property</var> is null, return null.

  <li>If <var>element</var> has a [[style]] attribute set, and that attribute has
  the effect of setting <var>property</var>, return the value that it sets
  <var>property</var> to.

  <li>If <var>element</var> is a [[font]] element that has an attribute whose
  effect is to create a [[presentationalhint]] for <var>property</var>, return
  the value that the hint sets <var>property</var> to.

  <li>If <var>element</var> is in the following list, and <var>property</var> is
  equal to the CSS property name listed for it, return the string listed for
  it.

  <dl class=switch>
    <dt>[[b]]
    <dt>[[strong]]
    <dd>font-weight: "bold"

    <dt>[[i]]
    <dt>[[em]]
    <dd>font-style: "italic"
  </dl>

  <li>Return null.
</ol>

<p>A <dfn>modifiable element</dfn> is a [[b]], [[em]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
[[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with no attributes except
possibly [[style]]; or a [[font]] element with no attributes except possibly
[[style]], [[fontcolor]], [[fontface]], and/or [[fontsize]]; or an [[a]]
element with no attributes except possibly [[style]] and/or [[href]].

<p>A <dfn>simple modifiable element</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span> for
which at least one of the following holds:

<ul>
  <li>It is an [[a]], [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
  [[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with no attributes.

  <li>It is an [[a]], [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
  [[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with exactly one attribute,
  which is [[style]], which sets no CSS properties (including invalid or
  unrecognized properties).

  <li>It is an [[a]] element with exactly one attribute, which is [[href]].

  <li>It is a [[font]] element with exactly one attribute, which is either
  [[fontcolor]], [[fontface]], or [[fontsize]].

  <li>It is a [[b]] or [[strong]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), which is "font-weight".

  <li>It is an [[i]] or [[em]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), which is "font-style".

  <li>It is an [[s]] element with exactly one attribute, which is [[style]], and
  the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property (including invalid or
  unrecognized properties), which is "text-decoration", which is set to
  "line-through" or "underline" or "none".

  <li>It is a [[u]] element with exactly one attribute, which is [[style]], and
  the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property (including invalid or
  unrecognized properties), which is "text-decoration", which is set to
  "line-through" or "underline" or "none".

  <li>It is a [[sub]] or [[sup]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), which is "vertical-align".

  <li>It is an [[a]], [[font]], or [[span]] element with exactly one attribute,
  which is [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties).
</ul>

<p class=note>Conceptually, a simple modifiable element is a modifiable element
which <span title="specified value">specifies</span> a value for at most one
command.

<p>When the user agent is to move a [[node]] to a new location, <dfn>preserving
ranges</dfn>, it must remove the [[node]] from its original [[parent]], then
insert it in the new location.  In doing so, however, it must ignore the
regular [[rangemutationrules]], and instead follow these rules:

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>node</var> be the moved [[node]], <var>old parent</var> and
  <var>old index</var> be the old [[parent]] and [[index]], and <var>new
  parent</var> and <var>new index</var> be the new [[parent]] and [[index]].

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[bpnode]] is the same as or a [[descendant]] of
  <var>node</var>, leave it unchanged, so it moves to the new location.  <!--
  This is actually implicit, but I state it anyway for completeness. -->

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[bpnode]] is <var>new parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is greater than <var>new index</var>, add one to its
  [[bpoffset]].

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[bpnode]] is <var>old parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is <var>old index</var> or <var>old index</var> + 1, set its
  [[bpnode]] to <var>new parent</var> and add <var>new index</var> &minus;
  <var>old index</var> to its [[bpoffset]].

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[bpnode]] is <var>old parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is greater than <var>old index</var> + 1, subtract one from its
  [[bpoffset]].
</ol>

<p>The <dfn>CSS styling flag</dfn> is a boolean flag, which must initially be
false.

<p class=XXX>Is the styling flag associated with the document, with the editing
host, what?  Needs reverse-engineering.

<p>When the user agent is instructed to run a particular method, it must follow
the steps defined for that method in the appropriate specification, not act as
though the method had actually been called from JavaScript.  In particular,
if the author has overridden the method with a custom method, the standard
method must be run rather than the custom one.

<p>When a list or set of [[nodes]] is assigned to a variable without specifying
the order, they must be initially in [[treeorder]], if they share a root.
(If they don't share a root, the order will be specified.)  When the user agent
is instructed to run particular steps for each member of a list, it must do so
sequentially in the list's order.


<h2>Decomposing a range into nodes</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>decompose</dfn> a [[range]] <var>range</var>,
it must run the following steps.

<p class=note>For this algorithm to be correct, it is essential that user
agents follow the [[rangemutationrules]], particularly those for <code
title>splitText()</code>.

<ol>
  <li>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] are the same,
  return an empty list.

  <li>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] is a [[text]] node and
  its [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]] is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of its
  [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]], run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
  title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText()</code> on its [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]]
  with argument equal to its [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]].

  <li>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]] is a [[text]] node and
  its [[rangeend]] [[bpoffset]] is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of its
  [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]], run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
  title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText()</code> on its [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]]
  with argument equal to its [[rangeend]] [[bpoffset]].

  <!-- Now we want to make sure our range contains as many nodes as possible,
  such as by changing <tag>[foo]</tag> to {<tag>foo</tag>}. -->
  <li>Let <var>cloned range</var> be the result of calling <code
  data-anolis-spec=domrange title=dom-Range-cloneRange>cloneRange()</code> on
  <var>range</var>.

  <li>While the [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]] of <var>cloned range</var> is 0,
  and the [[parent]] of <var>cloned range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] is
  not null, set the [[rangestart]] of <var>cloned range</var> to ([[parent]] of
  [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]], [[index]] of [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]]).

  <li>While the [[rangeend]] [[bpoffset]] of <var>cloned range</var> equals the
  [[nodelength]] of its [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]], and the [[parent]] of
  <var>clone range</var>'s [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]] is not null, set the
  [[rangeend]] of <var>cloned range</var> to ([[parent]] of [[rangeend]]
  [[bpnode]], 1 + [[index]] of [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]]).

  <li>Return a list consisting of every [[node]] [[contained]] in <var>cloned
  range</var> in [[treeorder]], omitting any whose [[parent]] is also
  [[contained]] in <var>cloned range</var>.
</ol>


<h2>Clearing an element's value</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>clear the value</dfn> of an element, it must run
the following steps:

<p class=note>Clearing the value of an element can remove it from its parent
and put other nodes in its place.  When implementations do something like clear
the value of all children of an element, they should take care not to assume
that the set of children won't change as they're cleared.  If the element is
removed, the algorithm will return the list of nodes inserted in its place.

<!-- If we wanted to be extra-pedantic, we could convert, e.g., <font color=red
id=foo> into <span id=foo> instead of <font id=foo>, but probably not worth it.
-->

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>element</var> be the [[element]] to be cleared.

  <li>Let <var>command</var> be as in the invoking algorithm.

  <li>If <var>element</var>'s <span>specified value</span> for
  <var>command</var> is null, return the empty list.  <!-- We want to abort
  early so that we don't try unsetting background-color on a non-inline
  element. -->

  <li>If <var>element</var> is a <span>simple modifiable element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>children</var> be the [[children]] of <var>element</var>.

    <li>While <var>element</var> has [[children]], insert its first [[child]]
    into its [[parent]] immediately before it, <span>preserving ranges</span>.

    <li>Remove <var>element</var> from its [[parent]].
    <!-- Notice that a boundary point that was immediately before or after the
    element will now be immediately before or after its children, just because
    of the regular range mutation rules, without needing to worry about
    preserving ranges.  Preserving ranges is only necessary for the sake of
    boundary points in the element or its descendants. -->

    <li>Return <var>children</var>.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "strikethrough", and <var>element</var> has a
  [[style]] attribute that sets "text-decoration" to some value containing
  "line-through", delete "line-through" from the value.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "underline", and <var>element</var> has a
  [[style]] attribute that sets "text-decoration" to some value containing
  "underline", delete "underline" from the value.

  <li>If the <span>relevant CSS property</span> for <var>command</var> is not
  null, unset that property of <var>element</var>.

  <li>If <var>element</var> is a [[font]] element:

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>command</var> is "foreColor", unset <var>element</var>'s
    [[fontcolor]] attribute, if set.

    <li>If <var>command</var> is "fontName", unset <var>element</var>'s
    [[fontface]] attribute, if set.

    <li>If <var>command</var> is "fontSize", unset <var>element</var>'s
    [[fontsize]] attribute, if set.

<h2>Pushing down values</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>push down values</dfn> to a [[node]]
<var>node</var>, given a command <var>command</var> and a new value
<var>new value</var>, it must run the following steps:

<div class=XXX>
<p>This algorithm goes up to just below the nearest ancestor with the right
style, then re-applies the bad styles repeatedly going down, omitting the
things we want to have the new style.  This is basically what WebKit does,
although WebKit sometimes starts higher up and therefore makes more intrusive
changes, often creating more markup.  IE follows the same general approach too.

<p>Gecko instead seems to start breaking up elements from the bottom, so that the
range consists of a few consecutive siblings, and it can then break up the
problematic element into a maximum of two pieces.  The spec's approach seems to
create fewer elements and simpler markup (or at least markup that's no more
complex) in most cases I throw at it.

<p>Gecko's approach does have the major advantage that it gets underlines right in
many cases for free.  E.g.,

<xmp>  <u>foo<font color=red>[bar]baz</font></u>
  -> <u>foo</u><font color=red>bar<u>baz</u></font> (spec)
  -> <u>foo</u><font color=red>bar</font><u><font color=red>baz</font></u> (Gecko)</xmp>

<p>The spec's markup here is much shorter and contains fewer elements, but is
wrong: the underline under "baz" has changed color from black to red.  It might
be worth trying to copy Gecko's results in such cases, but that won't solve all
underline problems, so perhaps it's not worth it.

<p>Opera also seems to break up the markup surrounding the range, but even more
aggressively: even if it doesn't need to pull down styles.  In some cases this
does actually result in shorter markup, specifically if the existing tags are
short (like [[i]] or [[b]]) and we're adding tags that are long (like [[span]]
with a [[style]] attribute).

<h2>Setting the value of a node</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>set the value</dfn> of a [[node]]
<var>node</var>, it must run the following steps.  There are two inputs: a
command <var>command</var> and a new value <var>new value</var>.

<div class=note>
<p>The effect of this algorithm is to ensure that the node and all its
descendants have the style requested, no matter what, producing the simplest
markup possible to achieve that effect.  It's inspired by the approach WebKit
takes.  The only places where the algorithm should fail are when there's an
!important CSS rule that conflicts with the requested style (which we don't try
to override because we assume it's !important for a reason), or when it's
literally impossible to succeed (such as when a text-decoration is propagated
from an ancestor we can't reach).  Any other failures are bugs.

<p>First, if the node is an element with an inline style rule for this
property, we unset it ("clearing styles").  This step also removes <span
title="simple modifiable element">simple modifiable elements</span> entirely, and
replaces elements like [[b]] or [[font]] with [[span]]s if they aren't simple
styling elements.  This will be sufficient if the desired style is inherited
from an ancestor, or if it's the default (like font-style: normal) and no
conflicting style is inherited from an ancestor.  Even if clearing styles
doesn't actually fix the style of the node we're dealing with, we do it anyway
to simplify the generated markup.

<p>If clearing styles didn't work, and it looks like an ancestor has inline
style that we're inheriting, we push the style down from that ancestor.  Thus
if we're unbolding the letter "r" in

<xmp><b>foo <i>bar</i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>we get

<xmp><b>foo </b><i><b>ba</b>r</i><b> baz</b>.</xmp>

<p>If we didn't push down styles, the final step (forcing styles) would instead
give us

<xmp><b>foo <i>ba<span style="font-weight: normal">r</span></i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>which is much longer and uglier.  We take care not to disturb the style or
semantics of anything but the node we're dealing with.

<p>We'll only push down styles if some ancestor actually has the style we want,
so we can inherit it.  Otherwise, it will just create useless markup.

<p>Finally, if neither of the above strategies worked, we have to add new
markup to get the desired style ("forcing styles").  First we try just sticking
it into its previous or next sibling, if that's a <span>simple modifiable
element</span> (so it won't add any styles or semantics we don't want).
Otherwise, we create a new simple styling element and wrap it in that.  It's
common that a previous sibling is the simple styling element we want, because
often we'll style several consecutive siblings in succession.  In that case,
the element created for the first can be reused for the later ones.

<p>This last step works a bit differently if the node is an <span>unwrappable
element</span>.  In that case, wrapping it in a simple styling element would
make the document less conforming than it already was.  Instead, we recursively
force style on its children.  The recursion will terminate when we hit a node
that's wrappable, or when there are no further descendants.

<p>After all this, the node is guaranteed to have the style we want, barring
bugs in the algorithm or the two exceptions noted earlier (!important style
rules, and impossible cases).  We then re-run the algorithm on each child
recursively.  Typically this means just clearing the style of each descendant,
because it should then inherit the style we just set on its ancestor.  In the
unusual case that a descendant's style is wrong even after we clear style on
it, such as because of a non-inline style rule (like trying to unbold a
heading), we'll repeat the above steps to ensure that the style really gets set
as desired.

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>The <dfn title=execCommand()><code>execCommand(<var>commandId</var>,
<var>showUI</var>, <var>value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the
<code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface allows scripts to
perform actions on the current selection or at the current caret position.
Generally, these commands would be used to implement editor UI, for example
having a "delete" button on a toolbar.

<p>There are three variants to this method, with one, two, and three arguments
respectively. The <var>showUI</var> and <var>value</var>
parameters, even if specified, are ignored except where otherwise stated.

<p>When <code>execCommand()</code> is invoked, the user agent must take the
action from the list below given by <var>commandId</var> on the
[[contextobject]]'s first [[range]].  If no action is given or if there is no
[[range]] in the [[contextobject]], do nothing.

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandState()><code>queryCommandState(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the state of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
first [[range]], as given by the list below.  If there is no [[range]] in the
[[contextobject]], or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return false.
<!-- Gecko throws an exception if there are no ranges in the selection, but
other engines seem to just return false, which seems like nicer behavior
anyway.

Requesting the state of an unknown command throws an exception in IE 9 RC
and Firefox 4b11, and returns boolean false in Chrome 10 and Opera 11. -->

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandValue()><code>queryCommandValue(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the value of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
first [[range]], as given by the list below.  If there is no [[range]] in the
[[contextobject]], or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return the empty string.
<!-- Requesting the value of an unknown command throws an exception in
IE 9 RC and in Firefox 4b11.  It returns boolean false in Chrome 10, and the
empty string in Opera 11. -->

<p class=XXX>Querying the value or state of an unrecognized command throws an
exception in IE and Firefox.  Need to consider changing to that behavior.

<p>The possible values for <var>commandId</var>, and their corresponding
meanings, are as follows.  These values must be compared to the argument in an
<span data-anolis-spec=domcore>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner.  The
<dfn>relevant CSS property</dfn> of a command is defined here, and is null if
omitted for a particular command.

<dd><strong>Action</strong>:

<div class=XXX>
<p>We have three behaviors to choose from for this one:

<ol>
  <li>Chrome 11 dev and IE 9 RC treat it the same as hiliteColor (although IE 9
  RC doesn't support hiliteColor itself).

  <li>Firefox 4 in non-CSS mode sets the bgcolor of the nearest td or body, or
  something like that.  In testing, it seems to jump out of contenteditable
  elements to style non-editable ancestors, which is alarming.

  <li>Firefox 4 in CSS mode and Opera 11 set the background of the nearest
  block container, although it doesn't seem to be very dependable (probably I
  just don't get what exactlyit's doing).
</ol>

<p>(1) is obviously redundant, but has plurality support, so we could spec it
that way if the other ways were useless.

<p>(3) is incoherent from a user perspective.  For instance, if you try it on
paragraphs the background will have big gaps where the margins are.  If you try
it on an inline element that's a child of the editing host, it will do nothing
or apply the background to everything or such, even though such an inline
element is visually indistinguishable from one sitting inside a div.  This
would only make sense if we take considerable effort to ensure that block
elements all have no margins, or if we wrap things in a div if they have
margins, or something like that.

<p>That leaves (2).  That might be useful if it actually set the document's
background color, but it seems like it sets table cell backgrounds sometimes
instead, which is really confusing.

<p>The path of least resistance seems to be to standardize this as meaning the
same thing as hiliteColor, and make up new commands if we want to do things
like set the document background color.  Feedback appreciated on this point.

  <!-- There are three approaches here.  For instance, if you ask browsers to

  IE 9 RC and Opera 11 produce simply:

  The last behavior produces valid markup (unlike Gecko), is simple (unlike

Setting an empty font-family has the effect of inheriting the font from the
parent (although I don't see where the February 24, 2011 CSS 3 Fonts draft says
that).  Thus it makes sense that if we special-case this, it should be to unset
the font somehow.

Special-casing the empty string to do nothing doesn't make sense to me.  With
createLink we'd expect the user to enter the URL themselves, so it makes sense
to special-case clicking OK without entering anything.  But here it's very
likely that the font list will be fixed by the author (how many users will
understand CSS font-family syntax?), so I don't think such usability concerns

Chrome 11 dev: Gives the literal value of font-family, except if it's inherited

  to return the exact font name.
Opera 11: Returns the literal value of font-family, except if it's inherited

I'm just going to punt on this and say it should be the computed value of
font-family.  I'll leave CSSOM to decide what that means if there are no

block and inline elements.  Given the name ("hiliteColor"), we really only want
to apply it to inline elements.  This is how everyone but Gecko behaves, but
Gecko sometimes applies it to blocks too.  WebKit doesn't set it on non-inline
elements, but does clear it and push it down from them.

The spec doesn't do any of these: background-color on non-inline elements is
not touched by hiliteColor, neither created nor removed.  If users want to
remove the style, they need to use removeFormat.  Adding it usually makes no

<div class=XXX>
<p>There are a lot of problems with underline color and thickness, because
text-decoration in CSS is horrible:

<ul>
  <li>Pushing down underlines can change their color, since the color of an
  underline follows the color of the element where it's declared instead of the
  text it's drawn under.  This could be fixed by adding a special case for this
  condition and inserting extra color rules, such as by setting a color on the
  underlining element and then having another element inside it that resets the
  color.  Horrible, but that's text-decoration for you.  Alternatively, the new
  text-decoration-color property in the CSS 3 Text draft could come in handy
  here, in which case we'd degrade pretty gracefully in legacy UAs.

  <li>Underline thickness depends on font-size in all rendering engines but
  WebKit, so pushing them down creates thickness problems as well as color
  problems.  Working around this is a similar story to the previous, except we
  have no text-decoration-width property yet (see <a
  href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0593.html">feedback
  to www-style</a>).

  <li>The preceding two points can't be avoided, because the only way to remove
  underlines in CSS is to push down styles (unlike most other things where you
  could override it).  Recent (February 2011) CSS 3 Text drafts have added
  support for a "text-decoration-line: cancel-underline" property, but we can
  only use that if there's no other possibility, since it won't work in legacy
  browsers.  (Although we should use it once there's no other possibility.)

  <li>More generally, from a user's perspective, color and thickness of
  underlines is going to be more or less random if they're applying them to
  text with varying size or color.  If they underline a bunch of text all at
  once, it will all get the same color/thickness, probably.  But if they
  underline letter-by-letter, it probably will vary.  But sometimes when they
  underline a bunch of text at once it will also vary, if the algorithm decides
  to create multiple elements for whatever reason (like an intervening
  unwrappable element).  This is unlikely to match user expectations.  There's
  not much we can do about this without entirely revamping text-decoration, so
  we'll have to live with it.

  <li>Currently we don't treat non-underline text-decorations properly, because
  we have no way to set (or cancel) underlines independently of other
  text-decorations from within CSS.  I've sent <a
  href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0591.html">feedback
  to www-style</a>.
</ul>

<p>I'll revisit some of these issues when I get feedback on www-style, either
using the newly-specced features or working around their absence as the case
may be.

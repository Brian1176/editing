<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This specification defines commands to edit HTML documents programmatically.
The APIs specified here were originally introduced in Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, but have subsequently been copied by other browsers in a haphazard
and imprecise fashion.  Although the behavior specified here does not exactly
match any browser at the time of writing, it can serve as a target to converge
to in the future.

<p>Where the reasoning behind the specification is of interest, such as when
major preexisting rendering engines are known not to match it, the reasoning is
included in HTML comments so as not to distract the reader.


<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>I'm not sure if my priorities in writing the algorithms here are correct.
My goals were 1) make the algorithms as simple as possible, and 2) minimize
surprising user-visible behavior (e.g., "I clicked B but it didn't turn
bold!").  I didn't try to optimize the niceness of the resulting DOM at all, so
for instance, when bolding <code title>abc &lt;i>def&lt;/i> &lt;br> ghi</code>
you get <code title>&lt;b>abc &lt;/b>&lt;i style="font-weight:
bold">def&lt;/i>&lt;b> &lt;/b>&lt;br style="font-weight: bold">&lt;b>
ghi&lt;/b></code> instead of wrapping the whole thing in a single <code
title>&lt;b></code>.  This is to avoid making the algorithm understand content
models, but maybe it's worth revisiting later.  Likewise, unbolding the middle
word of <code title>&lt;b>Foo bar baz&lt;/b></code> produces <code
title>&lt;b>Foo &lt;span style="font-weight: normal">bar&lt;/span>
baz&lt;/b></code> instead of the simpler <code title>&lt;b>Foo &lt;/b>bar&lt;b>
baz&lt;/b></code>.  For now, the algorithm works, even if it produces messy
DOMs.

<p>Other issues:

<ul>
  <li><p>Need to make CSS terminology more precise, about setting/unsetting CSS
  properties.  The intent is to modify the style attribute, CSSOM-style.
  Likewise, CSS value comparisons need to be done after serializing both
  values, so "bold" == "700" and "red" == "#f00" and so on.

  <li><p>Also not sure about computed style.  There are differences between
  "computed" and "used" and things like that, what do we actually want here?

  <li><p>The wording I use for DOM stuff is a bit of a mess, often either
  imprecise or unreasonably verbose.  I'm not quite sure how to fix it.

  <li><p>I haven't put any thought yet into collapsed ranges or selections.
  Currently my algorithms mostly do nothing if the selection is collapsed,
  which is of course wrong.  E.g., bold with collapsed selection should put
  &lt;b>&lt;/b> at the cursor, generally.

  <li><p>I also don't pay attention to what happens to the selection when you
  mutate the DOM.  This is essential.
</ul>


<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>A [[node]] is an <dfn>HTML element</dfn> if it is an [[element]] whose
[[namespace]] is the [[htmlnamespace]].  An <code
data-anolis-spec=domcore>Attr</code> is an <dfn>HTML attribute</dfn> if its
<span data-anolis-spec=domcore title=concept-attr-namespace>namespace</span> is
the [[htmlnamespace]].

<p>The <dfn>first node</dfn> of a [[range]] is the [[node]] returned by the
following algorithm:

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>range</var> be the [[range]] under discussion.

  <li><p>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]] is equal to
  the [[nodelength]] of its [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]], return the first
  [[node]] that is after the [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] and all its
  [[descendants]] (if any) in [[treeorder]].  If there is no such [[node]],
  return the last [[node]] in the document.

  <li><p>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] is a [[text]],
  [[comment]], or [[processinginstruction]] node, return that.

  <li><p>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] has children,
  return the child whose [[index]] is equal to <var>range</var>'s
  [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]].

  <li><p>Return <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]].
</ol>

<p>The <dfn>beginning element</dfn> of a [[range]] is its <span>first
node</span> if that is an [[element]]; or the parent of its <span>first
node</span>, if <em>that</em> is an [[element]]; or else null.

<p class=XXX>(It will be null only in weird cases, like selecting a comment
whose parent is a document, or the child of a document fragment, or whatever.
I'm ignoring those cases for now.)

<p>The <dfn>active range</dfn> of a [[document]] is the value returned by the
following algorithm:

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>selection</var> be the result of calling [[getselection]] on
  the [[document]].

  <li><p>If there are no [[range]]s associated with <var>selection</var>,
  return null.

  <li><p>Let <var>start</var> be the [[boundarypoint]] with the earliest
  [[bpposition]] among all of <var>selection</var>'s [[range]]s'
  [[rangestarts]].

  <li><p>Return the last [[range]] in <var>selection</var> whose [[rangestart]]
  is <var>start</var>.
  <!-- This is what Firefox seems to do, no reason to change it . . . -->

  <p class=note>In user agents that support only one [[range]] per
  [[selection]], the active range is simply the only one in the selection.
</ol>

<p>When the user agent is instructed to run a particular method, it must follow
the steps defined for that method in the appropriate specification, not act as
though the method had actually been called from JavaScript.  In particular,
if the author has overridden the method with a custom method, the standard
method must be run rather than the custom one.


<h2>Decomposing a Range into Nodes</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>decompose a [[range]]</dfn> <var
title>range</var>, it must run the following steps.

<p class=note>The algorithm returns a list of [[node]]s in the [[range]] that
are not contained in any other [[node]] in the [[range]].  It splits [[text]]
nodes if necessary, but isn't picky about [[comment]]s or
[[processinginstruction]]s.

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>, <var
  title>end node</var>, and <var>end offset</var> be the [[rangestart]]
  and [[rangeend]] [[bpnodes]] and [[bpoffsets]] of <var>range</var>,
  respectively.

  <li><p>If <var>start node</var> or <var>end node</var> is not an
  [[element]], [[text]], [[processinginstruction]], or [[comment]] node, or is
  not an [[element]] and has no parent, abort these steps.

  <p class=XXX>Figure out something sensible here.

  <li><p>If <var>start node</var> and <var>end node</var> are both
  [[text]] nodes, and <var>start node</var> is the same as <var>end
  node</var>, and neither <var>start offset</var> nor <var>end
  offset</var> is equal to 0 or the [[nodelength]] of <var>start
  node</var>:

  <ol>
    <li><p>Run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
    title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>start offset</var>)</code> on
    <var>start node</var> and set <var>start node</var> to the
    result.

    <li><p>Run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
    title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>end offset</var> &minus; <var
    title>start offset</var>)</code> on <var>start node</var>.

    <li><p>Return the list consisting of the single [[node]] <var>start
    node</var>, and abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li><p>If <var>start node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>start
  offset</var> is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of <var>start
  node</var>, run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
  title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>start offset</var>)</code> on
  <var>start node</var> and set <var>start node</var> to the
  returned node.  Set <var>start offset</var> to 0.

  <li><p>If <var>end node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>end
  offset</var> is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of <var>end
  node</var>, run <code data-anolis-spec=domcore
  title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>end offset</var>)</code> on
  <var>end node</var>.

  <li><p>If <var>start offset</var> is nonzero and equals the [[nodelength]] of
  <var>start node</var>, let <var>node</var> be the first [[node]] after
  <var>start node</var> in [[treeorder]].  If there is no such [[node]], return
  the empty list.

  <li><p>Otherwise, if <var>start node</var> is an [[element]] with at least
  one child, let <var>node</var> be the <var>start offset</var>th child of
  <var>start node</var>.

  <li><p>Otherwise, let <var>node</var> be <var>start node</var>.

  <li><p>If <var>end node</var> is an [[element]] and <var>end
  offset</var> is not 0, let <var>end</var> be the child of <var
  title>end node</var> with [[index]] <var>end offset</var> &minus; 1.

  <li><p>Otherwise, if <var>end offset</var> is 0, let <var
  title>end</var> be the first [[node]] before <var>end node</var> in
  [[treeorder]].  If there is no such [[node]], return the empty list.

  <li><p>Otherwise, let <var>end</var> be <var>end node</var>.

  <!-- We try to include a node's parent instead of that node if possible,
  because this generally reduces the number of nodes we're handling.  So if the
  string "oo bar" was selected in <b>Foo <i>bar</i></b>, we'd add the <i> to
  the selection, even if the browser registered the end as the text node "bar".
  -->
  <li><p>While <var>node</var> is the first child of its parent and <var
  title>end</var> is not a [[descendant]] of <var>node</var>'s parent,
  set <var>node</var> to <var>node</var>'s parent.

  <li><p>While <var>end</var> is the last child of its parent and <var
  title>node</var> is not a [[descendant]] of <var>end</var>'s parent,
  set <var>end</var> to <var>node</var>'s parent.

  <li><p>Let <var>node list</var> be an empty list of [[node]]s.

  <li><p>While <var>node</var> is not after <var>end</var> in
  [[treeorder]]:

  <ol>
    <li><p>Append <var>node</var> to <var>node list</var>.

    <li><p>Set <var>node</var> to the first [[node]] in [[treeorder]] that is
    after <var>node</var> and all its [[descendants]] (if any).  If no such
    [[node]] exists, break out of these substeps.

    <li><p>While <var>node</var> is an [[ancestor]] of <var
    title>end</var>, set <var>node</var> to <var>node</var>'s first child.
  </ol>

  <li><p>Return <var>node list</var>.
</ol>


<h2>Unstyling an element</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>unstyle an element</dfn>, it must run the
following steps.

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>element</var> be the [[element]] to be unstyled.

  <li><p>Let <var>property name</var> and <var>tag list</var> be as
  in the invoking algorithm.

  <li><p>Let <var>element children</var> be the [[element]] children of
  <var>element</var>.

  <li><p><span title="unstyle an element">Unstyle</span> each [[element]] in
  <var>element children</var>, in order.

  <p class=note>Unstyling an element can change the number of children its
  parent has, so the list of children to unstyle needs to be computed
  beforehand.

  <li><p>If either

  <ul>
    <li><p><var>element</var> is an <span>HTML element</span> with
    [[localname]] either "span" or in <var>tag list</var>, and it has
    only a single attribute, and that attribute is named "style", and
    that style attribute sets only the CSS property <var>property
    name</var>; or

    <li><p><var>element</var> is an <span>HTML element</span> with
    [[localname]] in <var>tag list</var> and it has no attributes,
  </ul>

  <p>then:

  <ol>
    <li><p>Let <var>children</var> be an empty list of [[node]]s.

    <li><p>While <var>element</var> has children:

    <ol>
      <li><p>Let <var>child</var> be the first child of <var>element</var>.

      <li><p>Append <var>child</var> to <var>children</var>.

      <li><p>Insert <var>child</var> as the previous sibling of
      <var>element</var>.
    </ol>

    <li><p>Remove <var>element</var>.

    <li><p>Return <var>children</var>.
  </ol>

  <li><p>Unset the CSS property <var>property name</var> of <var>element</var>.

  <li><p>If <var>element</var> is not an <span>HTML element</span> or its
  [[localname]] is not in <var>tag list</var>, return the empty list.

  <li><p>Let <var>new element</var> be a new <span>HTML element</span> with
  [[localname]] "span", with the same attributes and [[ownerdocument]] as
  <var>element</var>.

  <li><p>Append <var>new element</var> to <var>element</var>'s
  parent as the previous sibling of <var>element</var>.

  <li><p>While <var>element</var> has children, append its first child
  as the last child of <var>new element</var>.

  <li><p>Remove <var>element</var>.

  <li><p>Return the one-[[node]] list consisting of <var>new element</var>.
</ol>


<h2>Styling a Range</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>style a [[range]]</dfn> <var>range</var>, it
must run the following steps.  There are three inputs: a CSS property name
<var>property name</var>, a new value <var>property value</var>, and a possibly
empty list of strings <var>tag list</var>.

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>node list</var> be the result of <span title="decompose
  a range">decomposing</span> <var>range</var>.

  <li><p>For each <var>node</var> in <var>node list</var>, in order:

  <ol>
    <li><p>If <var>node</var> is an <code
    data-anolis-spec=domcore>Element</code>:

    <ol>
      <li><p>Unset the CSS property <var>property name</var> of <var
      title>node</var>.

      <li><p>If the computed value of <var>property name</var> for
      <var>node</var> is not <var>property value</var>, set the CSS property
      <var>property name</var> of <var>node</var> to <var>property value</var>.
      <!-- This means we don't bother applying the property if the style is
      already present, e.g., from an ancestor.  But we do apply it if the
      element is the expected sort of element but the style is wrong anyway,
      e.g., <span style=font-weight:100><b>Foo</b></span> where b's style is
      font-weight: bold. -->

      <li><p>Let <var>element children</var> be the [[element]] children
      of <var>node</var>.

      <li><p><span title="unstyle an element">Unstyle</span> each [[element]]
      in <var>element children</var>, in order.

      <p class=note>Unstyling an element can change the number of children its
      parent has, so the list of children to unstyle needs to be computed
      beforehand.
    </ol>

    <li><p>Otherwise, if <var>node</var> is a <code
    data-anolis-spec=domcore>Text</code> node:

    <ol>
      <li><p>Let <var>tag</var> be the first string in <var>tag list</var>, or
      "span" if <var>tag list</var> is empty.

      <li><p>Let <var>new parent</var> be the result of calling <code
      data-anolis-spec=domcore
      title=dom-Document-createElement>createElement(<var>tag</var>)</code> on
      the [[ownerdocument]] of <var>node</var>.

      <li><p>Append <var>new parent</var> to <var>node</var>'s parent as the
      previous sibling of <var>node</var>.

      <li><p>If the computed value of <var>property name</var> on <var>new
      parent</var> is not equal to <var>property value</var>, set the CSS
      property <var>property name</var> of <var>new parent</var> to
      <var>property value</var>.
      <!-- This is needed if tag list is empty, but also if the correct style
      is being suppressed for some reason, like <span
      style=font-weight:100><b>Foo</b></span> where b is font-weight: bolder.
      -->

      <li><p>Append <var>node</var> to <var>new parent</var> as
      its last child.
    </ol>

    <li><p>Otherwise, do nothing.
  </ol>
</ol>
<!-- Out of IE9, Gecko, WebKit, and Opera, when asked to (e.g.) bold an
element, IE9 and WebKit and Opera wrap various descendants in <b> or <strong>;
Gecko just adds a style attribute.  The latter is simpler, particularly because
you then don't have to worry about making sure you only insert your tags in a
valid place (which you have to so that text/html serialization is possible, if
nothing else).  I originally specced the former approach, available in git
history. -->

<ol>
  <li><p>Let <var>node list</var> be the result of <span title="decompose

  <li><p>For each <var>node</var> in <var>node list</var>, in order:

    <li><p>If <var>node</var> is an <code

    <ol>
      <li><p>Let <var>extra nodes</var> be the result of <span

      <li><p>If <var>node</var> no longer has a parent:

      <ol>
        <li><p>Insert all the [[node]]s in <var>extra nodes</var> into

        <li><p>Continue with the next [[node]] in <var>node list</var>, if any.

        <p class=note>The next [[node]] will be the first in <var>extra

      </ol>

      <li><p>If the computed value of <var>property name</var> for <var

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>The <dfn title=execCommand()><code>execCommand(<var>commandId</var>,
<var>showUI</var>, <var>value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the
<code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface allows scripts to
perform actions on the current selection or at the current caret position.
Generally, these commands would be used to implement editor UI, for example
having a "delete" button on a toolbar.

<p>There are three variants to this method, with one, two, and three arguments
respectively. The <var>showUI</var> and <var>value</var>
parameters, even if specified, are ignored except where otherwise stated.

<p>When <code>execCommand()</code> is invoked, the user agent must take the
action from the list below given by <var>commandId</var> on the
[[contextobject]]'s <span>active range</span>.  If no action is given or if
there is no <span>active range</span>, do nothing.

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandState()><code>queryCommandState(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the state of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
<span>active range</span>, as given by the list below.  If there is no
<span>active range</span>, or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return false.
<!-- Gecko throws an exception if there are no ranges in the selection, but
other engines seem to just return false, which seems like nicer behavior
anyway.

Requesting the state of an unknown command throws an exception in IE 9 RC
and Firefox 4b11, and returns boolean false in Chrome 10 and Opera 11. -->

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandValue()><code>queryCommandValue(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the value of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
<span>active range</span>, as given by the list below.  If there is no
<span>active range</span>, or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return the empty string.
<!-- Requesting the value of an unknown command throws an exception in
IE 9 RC and in Firefox 4b11.  It returns boolean false in Chrome 10, and the
empty string in Opera 11. -->

<p class=XXX>Querying the value or state of an unrecognized command throws an
exception in IE and Firefox.  Need to consider changing to that behavior.

<p>The possible values for <var>commandId</var>, and their corresponding
meanings, are as follows.  These values must be compared to the argument in an
<span data-anolis-spec=html>ASCII case-insensitive</span> manner.

<dl>
<dt><code title><dfn title=command-backColor>backColor</dfn></code>

<dd><p><strong>Action</strong>: If <var>value</var> is not a valid CSS color,
the user agent must do nothing and abort these steps.  Otherwise, it must <span
title="style a range">style the [[range]]</span> with <var>property name</var>
equal to "background-color", <var>property value</var> equal to
<var>value</var>, and <var>tag list</var> equal to the empty list.
<!-- Firefox documentation says it normally sets the background color of the
document, but I can't get it to work at all in brief testing in 4b11.  (It says
it behaves differently in styleWithCss mode.)  Opera 11 appears to set the
background color of the nearest block container of the cursor, or something.
IE 9 RC and Chrome 10 behave as I'd expect, namely, they set the background of
the selection, just like all the other styling features.  I go with IE/WebKit.

Invalid colors are probably the same craziness as with foreColor.

Chrome 10 dev actually sets background, not background-color, so it resets all
the other background stuff.  I go with IE 9 RC and Opera 11, which only set
background-color. -->

<p class=XXX>Firefox and Opera use backColor to set the background color of the
whole document.  The hiliteColor command can then be used to set the background
of the selection (supported in all my test browsers except IE).  This
terminology is inconsistent with foreColor, but the model I've specced leaves
no way to change the document's overall background color.  I'm not sure how

      <!-- There are three approaches here.  For instance, if you ask browsers
      to create a link to "http://example.org" on the "b" here:

        <a href=http://example.com><b>Abc</b></a>

      Chrome 10 dev produces:

        <b><a href=http://example.com>A</a><a href=http://example.org>b</a>
        <a href=http://example.com>c</a></b>

      Firefox 4b11 produces (roughly):

        <a href=http://example.com><b>A<a href=http://example.org>b</a>c</b></a>

      IE 9 RC and Opera 11 produce simply:

        <a href=http://example.org><b>Abc</b></a>

      The last behavior produces valid markup (unlike Gecko), is simple (unlike
      WebKit), and probably best matches user expectations.  If you happen to
      miss out a character when selecting the link you want to change, do you
      really intend to only change the link of part of it? -->

<!-- UAs differ a bit in the details here:

IE 9 RC: Empty string sets <font face="">
Firefox 4b11: Empty string does nothing
Chrome 11 dev: Empty string does nothing, '"monospace"' same as 'monospace'
  (i.e., cannot escape font-family keywords because quotes are stripped,
  clearly wrong)
Opera 11: Empty string sets <font face="">

Setting an empty font-family has the effect of inheriting the font from the
parent (although I don't see where the February 24, 2011 CSS 3 Fonts draft says
that).  Thus it makes sense that if we special-case this, it should be to unset
the font somehow.

Special-casing the empty string to do nothing doesn't make sense to me.  With
createLink we'd expect the user to enter the URL themselves, so it makes sense
to special-case clicking OK without entering anything.  But here it's very
likely that the font list will be fixed by the author (how many users will
understand CSS font-family syntax?), so I don't think such usability concerns
apply. -->

<dd><p><strong>State</strong>: Always false.

<dd><p><strong>Value</strong>: The computed value of the CSS property
"font-family" for the <span>beginning element</span> of the [[range]].
<!-- Complicated.

IE 9 RC: Always the empty string.  Not very useful.
Firefox 4b11: Confusing.  Sometimes it returns generic family names, like
  "sans-serif".  Sometimes it gives specific font names, like "tt" when the
  font is specified as "monospace".  Sometimes it gives the literal font-family
  string.  Not sure what it's doing here.
Chrome 11 dev: Gives the literal value of font-family, except if it's inherited
  from default values (no explicit style declarations anywhere), when it seems
  to return the exact font name.
Opera 11: Returns the literal value of font-family, except if it's inherited
  from default values, when it returns the empty string.

I'm just going to punt on this and say it should be the computed value of
font-family.  I'll leave CSSOM to decide what that means if there are no
applicable style rules. -->

<dd><p><strong>Action</strong>: If <var>value</var> is not a valid CSS color,

<!-- Browsers are all over the place here.  IE 9 RC seems to treat unrecognized
colors as black, but everyone else ignores them.  There are also special rules
for certain things that aren't valid CSS colors, in some browsers, like:

IE 9 RC: "ffe" -> "#ffe", "123" -> "#123"
Firefox 4b11: "ffe" -> no style, "123" -> no style
Chrome 10 dev: "ffe" -> "#FFFFEE", "123" -> "#000123"
Opera 11: "ffe" -> "#0f0f0e", "123" -> "#010203"

Firefox seems to stick to just CSS colors, so with any luck that works.
"limegreen" works as expected in all browsers.  rgb(255, 255, 255) does too,
except in Opera, which tries to parse it in some crazy way and winds up with
"#00b025".  rgba() colors don't work as uniformly, but I don't see any reason
to prohibit them.  Best to just match CSS. -->

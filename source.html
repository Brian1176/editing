<h2 class=no-num>Status of this Document</h2>
<p>This document is an early draft of a specification for HTML editing APIs,
defining <code>execCommand()</code> and related functions.  It will eventually
be merged into the main <a href=http://www.whatwg.org/html>HTML</a>
specification, replacing the <a
href=http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dnd.html#editing-apis>Editing
APIs</a> section.  Although this spec is still very incomplete and will likely
be changed heavily before it's finished, feedback to <a
href=http://lists.whatwg.org/listinfo.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org>the WHATWG list</a>
is encouraged, particularly from implementers.


<h2 class=no-num>Table of contents</h2>
<!--toc-->


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This specification defines commands to edit HTML documents programmatically.
The APIs specified here were originally introduced in Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, but have subsequently been copied by other browsers in a haphazard
and imprecise fashion.  Although the behavior specified here does not exactly
match any browser at the time of writing, it can serve as a target to converge
to in the future.

<p>Where the reasoning behind the specification is of interest, such as when
major preexisting rendering engines are known not to match it, the reasoning is
included in HTML comments so as not to distract the reader.

<p>The principles I've used for writing this specification so far are:

<ul>
  <li>If all browsers that implement a particular feature agree on some detail
  of how it works, match them unless there's very good reason not to.  When
  it's not clear what behavior is best, try to follow the implementations with
  the most market share.  But if one browser's behavior is clearly better than
  the others', go with the better behavior.

  <li>If a command is issued to format some text in a particular way, we will
  format the text that way no matter what.  If the user clicks the "bold"
  button, they don't care that the text didn't become bold because of an
  external CSS rule or for any other reason, they only care that it didn't
  work.  The only exception (beyond where it's simply impossible, like
  propagated text-decorations we can't remove) is that we don't try to override
  !important rules from external stylesheets, although we also don't go out of
  our way to respect them.

  <li>When we're given a presentational command like "bold", don't modify
  anything other than presentational markup related to that command.  If an
  element has non-presentational attributes like id or class, don't split it up
  or remove it or anything.  At most convert it to a span, if it's some type of
  presentational element (where "presentational" here really means "browsers
  produce it in response to execCommand() so we need to treat it as
  presentational", so it includes things like [[strong]] and [[em]]).

  <li>Don't interfere with more markup than necessary.  If the user modifies
  only a small run of text, don't go around simplifying ancestors or siblings
  or whatever unless it's necessary to produce simpler markup in the place that
  was actually modified.

  <li>But if we are already changing around something's style, convert existing
  styles to the preferred format.  For instance, we use [[b]] for bold, and
  convert [[strong]] and &lt;[[span]] [[style]]="font-weight: bold"> if we
  happen to be modifying that node anyway.

  <li>Don't make the document less conforming than it originally was.  If we
  happen to make it more conforming, good, although we don't have to go out of
  our way to do that.  (In the future, I'll add a mode that supports using
  obsolete presentational elements instead of CSS for the sake of e-mail
  clients and such, and this rule will be bent in that mode.)

  <li>Keep the markup as concise as possible.  (I've received feedback that
  this is very important to authors.)  Ideally, the markup should look as
  simple and neat as what a human would have produced by hand-editing.  We do
  complicated manipulation to pull styles down from ancestors rather than
  having to use inline CSS, and make sure to tidy up any styles on elements
  that we happen to be modifying anyway.  Previous principles take precedence
  over this one, however.
</ul>


<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Need to make CSS terminology more precise, about setting/unsetting CSS
  properties.  The intent is to modify the style attribute, CSSOM-style.
  Likewise, CSS value comparisons need to be done after serializing both
  values, so "bold" == "700" and "red" == "#f00" and so on.

  <li>Also not sure about computed style.  There are differences between
  "computed" and "used" and things like that, what do we actually want here?

  <li>The wording I use for DOM stuff is a bit of a mess, often either
  imprecise or unreasonably verbose.  I'm not quite sure how to fix it.

  <li>I haven't put any thought yet into collapsed ranges or selections.
  Currently my algorithms mostly do nothing if the selection is collapsed,
  which is of course wrong.  E.g., bold with collapsed selection should put
  &lt;b>&lt;/b> at the cursor, generally.

  <li>I also don't pay attention to what happens to the selection when you
  mutate the DOM.  This is essential.

  <li>JavaScript can modify the DOM synchronously in some cases, such as DOM
  mutation events and onunload when moving around iframes and objects.  This
  has to be dealt with somehow.  (Pointed out by Ryosuke Niwa of WebKit: <a
  href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030730.html>1</a>
  <a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030751.html>2</a>)

  <li>I'm sloppy about handling things like nodes that don't descend from a
  Document, comments that are children of a Document, that sort of thing.  Not
  essential for prototyping, but needs to be cleaned up eventually.

  <li>I don't pay attention to whether designMode/contenteditable is actually
  set.  I should be doing things like not doing anything if the selection isn't
  editable, making sure not to break out of contenteditable regions, etc.
</ul>


<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>A [[node]] is an <dfn>HTML element</dfn> if it is an [[element]] whose
[[namespace]] is the [[htmlnamespace]].  An <code
data-anolis-spec=domcore>Attr</code> is an <dfn>HTML attribute</dfn> if its
<span data-anolis-spec=domcore title=concept-attr-namespace>namespace</span> is
the [[htmlnamespace]].

<p>A [[node]] is <dfn>effectively contained</dfn> in a [[range]] if either it
is [[contained]] in the [[range]]; or it is the [[range]]'s [[rangestart]]
[[bpnode]], it is a [[text]] node, and its [[nodelength]] is different from the
[[range]]'s [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]]; or it is the [[range]]'s [[rangeend]]
[[bpnode]], it is a [[text]] node, and the [[range]]'s [[rangeend]]
[[bpoffset]] is not 0.

<p class=note>A node is <span>effectively contained</span> in a range if and
only if it would be [[contained]] after the range is <span
title=decompose>decomposed</span>.

<p>The <dfn>active range</dfn> of a [[document]] is the value returned by the
following algorithm:

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>selection</var> be the result of calling [[getselection]] on
  the [[document]].

  <li>If there are no [[range]]s associated with <var>selection</var>,
  return null.

  <li>Let <var>start</var> be the [[boundarypoint]] with the earliest
  [[bpposition]] among all of <var>selection</var>'s [[range]]s'
  [[rangestarts]].

  <li>Return the last [[range]] in <var>selection</var> whose [[rangestart]]
  is <var>start</var>.
  <!-- This is what Firefox seems to do, no reason to change it . . . -->

  <p class=note>In user agents that support only one [[range]] per
  [[selection]], the active range is simply the only one in the selection.
</ol>

<p>An <dfn>unwrappable element</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span> which may
not be used where only [[phrasingcontent]] is expected (not counting unknown or
obsolete elements, which cannot be used at all).

<p>The <dfn>specified style</dfn> of an [[element]] for a given
<var>property</var> is returned by the following algorithm, which will return
either a CSS value or null:

<ol>
  <li>If the [[element]] has a <code data-anolis-spec=html
  title="the style attribute">style</code> attribute set, and that attribute has
  the effect of setting <var>property</var>, return the value that it sets
  <var>property</var> to.

  <li>If the [[element]] is a <code data-anolis-spec=html>font</code> element
  that has an attribute whose effect is to create a [[presentationalhint]] for
  <var>property</var>, return the value that the hint sets <var>property</var>
  to.

  <li>If the [[element]] is in the following list, and <var>property</var> is
  equal to the CSS property name listed for it, return the string listed for
  it.

  <dl class=switch>
    <dt>[[b]]
    <dt>[[strong]]
    <dd>font-weight: "bold"

    <dt>[[i]]
    <dt>[[em]]
    <dd>font-style: "italic"

    <dt>[[u]]
    <dd>text-decoration: "underline"
  </dl>

  <li>Return null.
</ol>

<p>A <dfn>simple styling element</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span> for
which at least one of the following holds:

<ol>
  <li>It is a [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[span]], [[strong]], or [[u]]
  element with no attributes.

  <li>It is a [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[span]], [[strong]], or [[u]]
  element with exactly one attribute, which is [[style]], which sets no CSS
  properties (including invalid or unrecognized properties).

  <li>It is a [[font]] element with one attribute, which is either
  [[fontcolor]], [[fontface]], or [[fontsize]].

  <li>It is a [[b]] or [[strong]] element with one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the only CSS property set by the [[style]] attribute
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties) is "font-weight".

  <li>It is an [[i]] or [[em]] element with one attribute, which is [[style]],
  and the only CSS property set by the [[style]] attribute (including invalid
  or unrecognized properties) is "font-style".

  <li>It is a [[u]] element with one attribute, which is [[style]], and the
  only CSS property set by the [[style]] attribute (including invalid or
  unrecognized properties) is "text-decoration", which is set to "underline" or
  "none".

  <li>It is a [[font]] or [[span]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties).
</ol>

<p>When the user agent is instructed to run a particular method, it must follow
the steps defined for that method in the appropriate specification, not act as
though the method had actually been called from JavaScript.  In particular,
if the author has overridden the method with a custom method, the standard
method must be run rather than the custom one.

<p>When a list or set of [[node]]s is assigned to a variable without specifying
the order, they must be initially in [[treeorder]], if they share a root.
(If they don't share a root, the order will be specified.)  When the user agent
is instructed to run particular steps for each member of a list, it must do so
sequentially in the list's order.


<h2>Decomposing a range into nodes</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>decompose</dfn> a [[range]] <var>range</var>,
it must run the following steps.

<ol>
  <li>If <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] are the same,
  return an empty list.

  <li>Let <var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>, <var>end node</var>,
  and <var>end offset</var> be <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] and
  [[rangeend]] [[bpnodes]] and [[bpoffsets]], respectively.

  <li>If <var>start node</var> is a [[text]] node and is the same as <var>end
  node</var>, and <var>start offset</var> is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]]
  of <var>start node</var>:

  <ol>
    <li>Set <var>start node</var> to the result of running <code
    data-anolis-spec=domcore title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>start
    offset</var>)</code> on <var>start node</var>.

    <li>Set <var>end node</var> to <var>start node</var>.

    <li>Set <var>end offset</var> to <var>end offset</var> &minus; <var>start
    offset</var>.

    <li>Set <var>start offset</var> to 0.
  </ol>

  <li>Otherwise, if <var>start node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>start
  offset</var> is neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of <var>start node</var>:

  <ol>
    <li>Set <var>start node</var> to the result of running <code
    data-anolis-spec=domcore title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>start
    offset</var>)</code> on <var>start node</var>.

    <li>Set <var>start offset</var> to 0.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>end node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>end offset</var> is
  neither 0 nor the [[nodelength]] of <var>end node</var>, run <code
  data-anolis-spec=domcore title=dom-Text-splitText>splitText(<var>end
  offset</var>)</code> on <var>end node</var>.

  <!-- The next two steps ensure that our fragmented text nodes are contained
  in the range. -->
  <li>If <var>start node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>start offset</var>
  is 0, set <var>start offset</var> to the [[index]] of <var>start node</var>,
  then set <var>start node</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>If <var>end node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>end offset</var> is
  its [[nodelength]], set <var>end offset</var> to one plus the [[index]] of
  <var>end node</var>, then set <var>end node</var> to its parent.

  <li>Set <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] to (<var>start node</var>,
  <var>start offset</var>) and its [[rangeend]] to (<var>end node</var>,
  <var>end offset</var>).

  <!-- Now we want to make sure our range contains as many nodes as possible,
  such as by changing <tag>[foo]</tag> to {<tag>foo</tag>}. -->
  <li>Let <var>cloned range</var> be the result of calling <code
  data-anolis-spec=domrange title=dom-Range-cloneRange>cloneRange()</code> on
  <var>range</var>.

  <li>While the [[rangestart]] [[bpoffset]] of <var>cloned range</var> is 0,
  and the [[parent]] of <var>cloned range</var>'s [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]] is
  not null, set the [[rangestart]] of <var>cloned range</var> to ([[parent]] of
  [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]], [[index]] of [[rangestart]] [[bpnode]]).

  <li>While the [[rangeend]] [[bpoffset]] of <var>cloned range</var> equals the
  [[nodelength]] of its [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]], and the [[parent]] of
  <var>clone range</var>'s [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]] is not null, set the
  [[rangeend]] of <var>cloned range</var> to ([[parent]] of [[rangeend]]
  [[bpnode]], 1 + [[index]] of [[rangeend]] [[bpnode]]).

  <li>Return a list consisting of every [[node]] [[contained]] in <var>cloned
  range</var> in [[treeorder]], omitting any whose [[parent]] is also
  [[contained]] in <var>cloned range</var>.
</ol>


<h2>Clearing an element's styles</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>clear styles</dfn> on an element, it must run
the following steps:

<p class=note>Clearing styles can remove it from its parent and put other nodes
in its place.  When implementations do something like clear style on all
children of an element, they should take care not to assume that the set of
children won't change as they're unstyled.  If the element is removed, the
algorithm will return the list of nodes inserted in its place.

<p class=XXX>This should probably convert, e.g., &lt;font color=red id=foo>
into &lt;span id=foo> instead of &lt;font id=foo>.

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>element</var> be the [[element]] to be unstyled.

  <li>Let <var>property</var> be as in the invoking algorithm.

  <li>If <var>element</var> is a <span>simple styling element</span> and its
  <span>specified style</span> for <var>property</var> is not null:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>children</var> be an empty list of [[node]]s.

    <li>While <var>element</var> has children:

    <ol>
      <li>Let <var>child</var> be the first child of <var>element</var>.

      <li>Append <var>child</var> to <var>children</var>.

      <li>Insert <var>child</var> as the previous sibling of
      <var>element</var>.
    </ol>

    <li>Remove <var>element</var> from its [[parent]].

    <li>Return <var>children</var>.
  </ol>

  <li>Unset the CSS property <var>property</var> of <var>element</var>.

  <li>If <var>element</var> is a <code data-anolis-spec=html>font</code>
  element:

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>property</var> is "color", unset <var>element</var>'s
    <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-font-color>color</code> attribute, if
    set.

    <li>If <var>property</var> is "font-family", unset
    <var>element</var>'s <code data-anolis-spec=html
    title=dom-font-face>face</code> attribute, if set.

    <li>If <var>property</var> is "font-size", unset <var>element</var>'s
    <code data-anolis-spec=html title=dom-font-size>size</code> attribute, if
    set.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>element</var>'s <var>specified style</var> for
  <var>property</var> is null, return the empty list.
  <!-- If we get past this step, we're something like <b class=foo> where we
  want to keep the extra attributes, so we stick them on a span. -->

  <li>Let <var>new element</var> be a new <span>HTML element</span> with
  [[localname]] "span", with the same attributes and [[ownerdocument]] as
  <var>element</var>.

  <li>Append <var>new element</var> to <var>element</var>'s
  parent as the previous sibling of <var>element</var>.

  <li>While <var>element</var> has children, append its first child
  as the last child of <var>new element</var>.

  <li>Remove <var>element</var> from its [[parent]].

  <li>Return the one-[[node]] list consisting of <var>new element</var>.
</ol>


<h2>Pushing down styles</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>push down styles</dfn> to a [[node]]
<var>node</var>, given a CSS property name <var>property</var> and a new value
<var>new value</var>, it must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is not an [[element]], abort this
  algorithm. <!-- E.g., a text node child of a document fragment. -->

  <li>If <var>node</var> is an [[element]] and <var>property</var> computes to
  <var>new value</var> on <var>node</var>, abort this algorithm.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is not an [[element]] and <var>property</var> computes
  to <var>new value</var> on <var>node</var>'s [[parent]], abort this
  algorithm.

  <li>Let <var>current ancestor</var> be <var>node</var>'s [[parent]].

  <li>Let <var>ancestor list</var> be a list of [[node]]s, initially empty.

  <li>While <var>current ancestor</var> is an [[element]] and
  <var>property</var> does not compute to <var>new value</var> on it, append
  <var>current ancestor</var> to <var>ancestor list</var>, then set
  <var>current ancestor</var> to its [[parent]].

  <!-- We can only remove specified styles, so if the style isn't specified,
  give up. -->
  <li>If <var>ancestor list</var> is not empty, and the <span>specified
  style</span> of <var>property</var> on the last member of <var>ancestor
  list</var> is null, abort this algorithm.

  <!-- If we go all the way up to the root and still don't have the desired
  style, pushing down styles is pointless.  It will create extra markup for no
  purpose. -->
  <li>If <var>ancestor list</var> is not empty, and the [[parent]] of the last
  member of <var>ancestor list</var> is not an [[element]], abort this
  algorithm.

  <li>While <var>ancestor list</var> is not empty:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>current ancestor</var> be the last member of <var>ancestor
    list</var>.

    <li>Remove the last member from <var>ancestor list</var>.

    <li>Let <var>propagated value</var> be the <span>specified style</span> of
    <var>current ancestor</var> for <var>property</var>.

    <li>If <var>propagated value</var> is null, continue this loop from the
    beginning.

    <li>Let <var>children</var> be the [[children]] of <var>current
    ancestor</var>.

    <li><span>Clear styles</span> on <var>current ancestor</var>.

    <li>For every <var>child</var> in <var>children</var>:

    <ol>
      <li>If <var>child</var> is <var>node</var>, continue with the next
      <var>child</var>.

      <li>If <var>child</var> is an [[element]] whose <span>specified
      style</span> for <var>property</var> is neither null nor equal to
      <var>propagated value</var>, continue with the next <var>child</var>.

      <li>If <var>child</var> is the last member of <var>ancestor list</var>,
      set <var>child</var>'s CSS property <var>property</var> to
      <var>propagated value</var> and continue with the next <var>child</var>.

      <p class=note>This style will be removed on the next loop iteration and
      distributed to its children.

      <li><span>Force the style</span> of <var>child</var>, with
      <var>property</var> as in this algorithm and <var>new value</var> equal
      to <var>propagated value</var>.
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>


<h2>Forcing the style of a node</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>force the style</dfn> of a [[node]]
<var>node</var>, given a CSS property name <var>property</var> and a new value
<var>new value</var>, it must run the following steps.

<p class=note>This algorithm checks if the node has the desired style, and if
not, it wraps the node (or, if that's not possible, its descendants) in a
<span>simple styling element</span>.  This is only used as a last resort after
<span title="clear styles">clearing styles</span> and <span title="push down
styles">pushing down styles</span> don't work to achieve the desired style.
After forcing the style, descendants might still have different style.

<ol>
  <!-- Even if the style matches, we stick it in a preceding sibling if
  possible.  This ensures "a<cite>b</cite>c" -> "<i>a<cite>b</cite>c</i>"
  instead of "<i>a</i><cite>b</cite><i>c</i>". -->
  <li>If <var>node</var> is an [[element]], [[text]], [[comment]], or
  [[processinginstruction]] node, and is not an <span>unwrappable
  element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[previoussibling]] is a <span>simple styling
    element</span> whose <span>specified style</span> and computed style for
    <var>property</var> are both <var>new value</var>, append <var>node</var>
    as the last [[child]] of its [[previoussibling]] and abort this algorithm.

    <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[nextsibling]] is a <span>simple styling
    element</span> whose <span>specified style</span> and computed style for
    <var>property</var> are both <var>new value</var>, insert <var>node</var>
    as the first [[child]] of its [[nextsibling]] and abort this algorithm.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>node</var> is an [[element]] and <var>property</var> computes to
  <var>new value</var> on <var>node</var>, abort this algorithm.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is not an [[element]], <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is
  an [[element]], and <var>property</var> computes to <var>new value</var> on
  <var>node</var>'s [[parent]], abort this algorithm.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is an <span>unwrappable element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>children</var> be all [[children]] of <var>node</var>,
    omitting any that are [[element]]s whose <span>specified style</span> for
    <var>property</var> is neither null nor equal to <var>new value</var>.

    <li><span>Force the style</span> of each [[node]] in <var>children</var>,
    with <var>property</var> and <var>new value</var> as in this invocation of
    the algorithm.

    <li>Abort this algorithm.
  </ol>

  <!-- At this point we have to make a new element as a wrapper.  This isn't
  worth the effort for comments or PIs, so abort in that case. -->

<h2>Styling a node</h2>
<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>style</dfn> a [[node]] <var>node</var>, it must
run the following steps.  There are two inputs: a CSS property name
<var>property</var> and a new value <var>new value</var>.

<div class=note>
<p>The effect of this algorithm is to ensure that the node and all its
descendants have the style requested, no matter what, producing the simplest
markup possible to achieve that effect.  It's inspired by the approach WebKit
takes.  The only places where the algorithm should fail are when there's an
!important CSS rule that conflicts with the requested style (which we don't try
to override because we assume it's !important for a reason), or when it's
literally impossible to succeed (such as when a text-decoration is propagated
from an ancestor we can't reach).  Any other failures are bugs.

<p>First, if the node is an element with an inline style rule for this
property, we unset it ("clearing styles").  This step also removes <span
title="simple styling element">simple styling elements</span> entirely, and
replaces elements like [[b]] or [[font]] with [[span]]s if they aren't simple
styling elements.  This will be sufficient if the desired style is inherited
from an ancestor, or if it's the default (like font-style: normal) and no
conflicting style is inherited from an ancestor.  Even if clearing styles
doesn't actually fix the style of the node we're dealing with, we do it anyway
to simplify the generated markup.

<p>If clearing styles didn't work, and it looks like an ancestor has inline
style that we're inheriting, we push the style down from that ancestor.  Thus
if we're unbolding the letter "r" in

<xmp><b>foo <i>bar</i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>we get

<xmp><b>foo </b><i><b>ba</b>r</i><b> baz</b>.</xmp>

<p>If we didn't push down styles, the final step (forcing styles) would instead
give us

<xmp><b>foo <i>ba<span style="font-weight: normal">r</span></i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>which is much longer and uglier.  We take care not to disturb the style or
semantics of anything but the node we're dealing with.

<p>We'll only push down styles if some ancestor actually has the style we want,
so we can inherit it.  Otherwise, it will just create useless markup.

<p>Finally, if neither of the above strategies worked, we have to add new
markup to get the desired style ("forcing styles").  First we try just sticking
it into its previous or next sibling, if that's a <span>simple styling
element</span> (so it won't add any styles or semantics we don't want).
Otherwise, we create a new simple styling element and wrap it in that.  It's
common that a previous sibling is the simple styling element we want, because
often we'll style several consecutive siblings in succession.  In that case,
the element created for the first can be reused for the later ones.

<p>This last step works a bit differently if the node is an <span>unwrappable
element</span>.  In that case, wrapping it in a simple styling element would
make the document less conforming than it already was.  Instead, we recursively
force style on its children.  The recursion will terminate when we hit a node
that's wrappable, or when there are no further descendants.

<p>After all this, the node is guaranteed to have the style we want, barring
bugs in the algorithm or the two exceptions noted earlier (!important style
rules, and impossible cases).  We then re-run the algorithm on each child
recursively.  Typically this means just clearing the style of each descendant,
because it should then inherit the style we just set on its ancestor.  In the
unusual case that a descendant's style is wrong even after we clear style on
it, such as because of a non-inline style rule (like trying to unbold a
heading), we'll repeat the above steps to ensure that the style really gets set
as desired.

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>The <dfn title=execCommand()><code>execCommand(<var>commandId</var>,
<var>showUI</var>, <var>value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the
<code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface allows scripts to
perform actions on the current selection or at the current caret position.
Generally, these commands would be used to implement editor UI, for example
having a "delete" button on a toolbar.

<p>There are three variants to this method, with one, two, and three arguments
respectively. The <var>showUI</var> and <var>value</var>
parameters, even if specified, are ignored except where otherwise stated.

<p>When <code>execCommand()</code> is invoked, the user agent must take the
action from the list below given by <var>commandId</var> on the
[[contextobject]]'s <span>active range</span>.  If no action is given or if
there is no <span>active range</span>, do nothing.

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandState()><code>queryCommandState(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the state of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
<span>active range</span>, as given by the list below.  If there is no
<span>active range</span>, or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return false.
<!-- Gecko throws an exception if there are no ranges in the selection, but
other engines seem to just return false, which seems like nicer behavior
anyway.

Requesting the state of an unknown command throws an exception in IE 9 RC

<p>The <dfn
title=queryCommandValue()><code>queryCommandValue(<var>commandId</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface must
return the value of <var>commandId</var> on the [[contextobject]]'s
<span>active range</span>, as given by the list below.  If there is no
<span>active range</span>, or if <var>commandId</var> is not on the list,
return the empty string.
<!-- Requesting the value of an unknown command throws an exception in

no way to change the document's overall background color.  I'm not sure how
important this is, but maybe I should switch, since hiliteColor is more

Setting an empty font-family has the effect of inheriting the font from the

that).  Thus it makes sense that if we special-case this, it should be to unset

Special-casing the empty string to do nothing doesn't make sense to me.  With
createLink we'd expect the user to enter the URL themselves, so it makes sense
to special-case clicking OK without entering anything.  But here it's very

  to return the exact font name.
Opera 11: Returns the literal value of font-family, except if it's inherited

I'm just going to punt on this and say it should be the computed value of
